# Visualizing_netflix_dataset_Power_BI
 Analyzing and visualizing dataset with 5000+ records of both movies and shows.
 
# Problems to Solve

1. Which was the best movie and TV show overall in the last 50 years?

2. How many movies do we have in our dataset across the last few years? Do we have more representation of movies from the last 20 years or is the dataset free from any such skewness?

3. On average, how has the IMDb score been trending over the last 50 years? Has it been deteriorating or improving?

4. Have more people started voting for movies/shows on IMDb over the last 50 years?

5. On average, how has the runtime changed over the last 50 years?

6. How does age certification of a movie affect its rating?

# Process

1) Requirement Gathering

Understand business problem, KPIs, and target users (e.g., sales trends, customer churn, cost reduction).

2) Data Collection

Import data from multiple sources (Excel, SQL Server, APIs, CSV, etc.).

3) Data Cleaning & Transformation

Use Power Query for cleaning (remove nulls, merge tables, reshape data).

Create data model with relationships using Power Pivot.

3) Data Enrichment

Create calculated columns and measures using DAX (e.g., YTD Sales, % Growth, Average Rating).

Apply hierarchies (date, geography, product categories).

4) Visualization & Dashboard Building

Build interactive dashboards with charts, slicers, KPIs, drill-throughs.

Use Conditional Formatting and custom visuals for better insights.

5) Insights & Analysis

Highlight key trends, correlations, and anomalies (e.g., “40% of sales come from 2 regions”).

6) Publishing & Sharing

Publish report to Power BI Service.

Set up workspaces, data refresh schedules, and role-based access.

7) Iteration & Optimization

Get stakeholder feedback, improve dashboard usability.

Optimize performance (reduce model size, use star schema, aggregate tables).
