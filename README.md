# Problems to Solve

1. Which was the best movie and TV show overall in the last 50 years?

2. How many movies do we have in our dataset across the last few years? Do we have more representation of movies from the last 20 years or is the dataset free from any such skewness?

3. On average, how has the IMDb score been trending over the last 50 years? Has it been deteriorating or improving?

4. Have more people started voting for movies/shows on IMDb over the last 50 years?

5. On average, how has the runtime changed over the last 50 years?

6. How does age certification of a movie affect its rating?
